# CSS - Practical Applications

## Custom Properties

Let's start by establishing our desired theme colors. For more information about selecting colors check out [Google's Material guidelines.](https://material.io/design/color/#color-theme-creation)

Once you've picked out your colors, let's use CSS Custom Properties to create a theme. By taking this approach, we can easily change our colors as they are all there in one place.

We'll start by selecting the 'root' element with the `:root` selector. This is essentially the same as using `html` as the selector, but is a bit more specific, so there is less chance of it being overridden inadvertently.

Next, we'll 'declare' a variable and assign a value like so:

```css
:root {
  --primary: #6200EE;
}
```

And to apply this variable to, for example, our `<h1>`:

```css
h1 {
  color: var(--primary);
}
```

Go ahead and build out your entire color palette as shown above, and practice applying colors to a few different elements.

BTW, we are only using 'hexadecimal' format to define our colors. But, there are other approaches such as specifying `RGB` values or even using: hue, saturation and lightness, among others. If, you're interested in the other formats, [check MDN's reference.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color)

Here's an example implementation:

```css
/* :root selector is basically same as 'html' in this context. */
:root {
  --primary: #6200ee;
  --primary-variant: #3700b3;
  --secondary: #03dac6;
  --secondary-variant: #018786;
  --background: #fff;
  --error: #b00020;
  --primary-text: #fff;
  --secondary-text: #000;
  --base-spacing: 8px;
  --border-primary: solid var(--primary-variant) 3px;
  --border-secondary: solid var(--secondary-variant) 3px;
}

body {
  font-family: "Poppins", sans-serif;
}

h1 {
  margin: calc(var(--base-spacing) * 2);
}

header,
section:nth-of-type(odd),
footer {
  background: var(--primary);
  color: var(--primary-text);
}

nav {
  border-top: var(--border-secondary);
  border-bottom: var(--border-secondary);
}

footer {
  border-top: var(--border-primary);
}

nav,
section:nth-of-type(even) {
  background: var(--secondary);
  color: var(--secondary-text);
}
```

## Spacing and `calc()`

From a design standpoint, it's nice when we can establish consistent spacing around all of the things. _One way_ we can do this is to establish a 'base' spacer, and then multiple it up from there.

1. in `:root`, create another variable called something like: `--spacer`. Give it a value of `8px.` [Why 8px?](https://builttoadapt.io/intro-to-the-8-point-grid-system-d2573cde8632)

2. Practice applying that with `margin` and/or `padding`.

3. Now apply this property to one of your `margin`s or `padding`s: `calc(var(--spacer) * 10)`

## CSS Units

There are many ways to express [units in CSS,](https://syntax.fm/show/107/hasty-treat-css-units). For our purposes, we will focus on `px` for most things it works well as a 'general purpose' unit.

However, for our font-sizes, we will use: `em`s. For better control over varying screen sizes and responsive behavior, we will also use `vw` (and `vh`).

Finally, remember that 'fancy' `calc` that we did üëÜüèæ? (`calc(var(--spacer) * 10)`). Well, there's actually another unit we can use, `rem`s, that simplifies things a bit.

## Flexing Our Layout

Now, let's concern ourselves with the layout of our page, starting with our mobile view (mobile-first web design).

One common approach, is to let our entire page take up `100vw`, and then apply a `display: flex` and `flex-direction: column` to prevent a single column mobile layout.

The general idea is that, from here, we will use `@media` (Media Queries) to 'respond' to some minimum screen sizes, and update our layout accordingly.

We will start by applying `flex` to our `<header>`. We will turn `<header>` into a _flexbox_ by applying `display: flex;` The result is that the **direct children** become `flex` children, and we can use some additional _flexbox_ properties and values to position things nicely.

Now that we have our 'logo' and 'tag line' centered nicely on mobile, let's learn about `border-radius`. Try the following:

```html
figure {
  border-radius: 20px;
}
```

Notice that all 4 corners of the `<figure>` are now rounded. Try the same thing, but try passing in 2 values, then 3 and then 4. Can you discern what the affect is?

Now, although we won't explicitly cover `%` units, as we tend to favor `vw` and `vh`, try the following: `border-radius: 50%`. As long as your `<img>` was a square to begin with, now it's a circle!

Another neat property is: `box-shadow`. With `box-shadow`, we can apply a shadow to things like the `<figure>.` Try the following rule on your `<figure>`: `box-shadow: 10px 20px 20px black`. Do you notice the dramatic shadow? (as always, do a 'hard refresh' to 'bust the cache' and see the changes. 'ctrl/cmd+Shift+R'). Usually, you can just play with the numbers to get the look you are after, but here are [the details `box-shadow`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow).
