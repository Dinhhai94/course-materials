# HTML

## HTML Overview

HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) is a markup language for describing the **structure and content** (for the most part, it should not contain any style rules or JS code) of web documents (web pages). It is comprised of markup tags and text content nested inside each other.

HTML tags are keywords (tag names) surrounded by angle brackets: `<tagname> content </tagname>`

- HTML tags normally come in pairs like `<p>` and `</p>`
- The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is the end tag
- The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a slash before the tag name

**Note:** For the following examples, let's use [CodePen](codepen.io) just to quickly play around with some HTML. We will be using this tool throughout the course for 'quick' exploration of the concepts, so you may want to create an account (just link it to your GitHub account).

By following the proscribed rules of HTML, a web browser understands this to be a document with a heading and a paragraph. Here is what the browser interpreter thinks when given the following code (paste this into CodePen under the HTML section):

```html
  <!-- Note that CodePen affords us the luxury of not having to have the 'boilerplate' `<head>` stuff or even `<body>` tags. We can focus exclusively on tags themselves. When we build 'real' pages in VS Code, this is not the case, but we have a neat trick that we can use there too so that we don't have to worry too much. -->
  <h1>My First Heading</h1>
  <p>My first paragraph.</p>
```

- The text between `<h1>` and `</h1>` describes a heading
- The text between `<p>` and `</p>` describes a paragraph

Now, try this:

```html
<h1>HTML Example 1</h1>
<p>[CMD + OPT + U] to view the source code of this HTML document.</p>
<p>Now close the source code and inspect the document in the Elements panel of your Chrome Developer Tools [CMD + OPT + I] instead</p>
<p>Use the magnifying glass in the top left to select elements in the window area.</p>
<p>
  W  O  A  h
    WHAT'S
  GO  -  ING
                    on


  h   e   r   e
              !
        !
  !
</p>
<!-- ALERT: THIS IS JUST A COMMENT -->

<!--

    SECRET: Developers often use comments to annotate their code.

            ...or complain about their bosses. They aren't rendered on the page.
            So only people who view the source code get to see them. Fun! -->

```

Let's apply our skills to our 'FirstnameLastname' project. Although we do have README.md, browsers don't display MarkDown by default. Instead we want to stick with the HTML standard as we started exploring above.

1. Make sure that you're inside your portfolio project directory (called `FirstnameLastname`).
2. All browsers look for an `index.html` file to display by default. You can name other pages whatever you'd like, but the landing page for every site should always be `index.html`.
3. In the blank file enter : `!` and press 'tab'. Thanks to the power of [Emmet](emmet.io) - which uses some 'built in' snippets and the power of advanced CSS selectors (later) to quickly genetate markup, we already have all of the critical 'boilerplate' code that we need to help ensure that browsers will display our content properly.
4. Use some of the content from your 'README.md' and 'recreate' the content you had there as HTML.

## Previewing HTML with a local Web Server

As you may already know, rendering content on the web involves a series of communications between clients (our browser) and servers (specially configured computers distributed throughout our planet). Clients send _requests_ for page contents and servers send _responses._ We will learn more about these details later when we build out a 'contact' `<form>`.

Now, we _could_ `push` our content up to the live web, but this process can take time. We need a simpler way to quickly and almost instantaneously see the changes we make to our content.

One option would be to manually open an HTML from Chrome, but ideally, and for consistency, it will be much better if we could 'simulate' a web server right on our local machines. Enter `http-server`.

`npm i http-server --save-dev`

The above command should look familiar from previous sections. We are adding another `'devDependency'`. If you're wondering about the `i`, well that's just short for `install`. It works the same as our previous `npm install`s.

Oh, and as usual, you should still be in your 'FirstnameLastname' directory.

Now, fire up your server like so: `npx http-server . -a 127.0.0.1`.

The result will be {% embed url="https://www.dropbox.com/s/k8bmvjztfw4ga5c/http-server.png?dl=0" caption="Launch a local web server with IP address: 127.0.0.1 and port 8080" %}

Essentially, what's happening here is that we have created a server that will load resources at the IP address: `127.0.0.1`. More specifically, resources will be served on _port_ `8080`. You can think of ports as 'channels' on a TV. Each _port_ on a serve, sends and receives different types of communications, whether it's for secure communication, email, file transfers, etc.

An IP address is an identifier for a server, and this particular IP address usually references a 'local' web server. Every site you visit uses a _domain name_ that maps to specific IP addresses via _domain name servers._ Here's additional info if you are interested:

  - [Internet vs web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work#Internet_and_the_web)
  - [Domain Names](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_domain_name)

So, to see your new website in the browser, kindly enter this as the URL(Uniform Resource Locator): `http://127.0.0.1:8080` (Just copy/paste it - in GitBash terminal, you need to do: 'ctrl+ins' to copy it).

## More HTML tags

Now try this (inside `<body>`)

```html
<h1>This is a header</h1>
<h2>This is an even smaller header</h2>
<h3>Even smaller...</h3>
<h6>Quite small</h6>
<p>Here is some normal text. A paragraph, even!</p>
<p><i>This text is in italics.</i></p>
<p><b>This text is in bold.</b></p>
<p><b><i>This text is in both.</i></b></p>
<p><del>This text is rendered with strikethrough.</del></p>
<p>Sometimes you want to embed some <i>stylized text</i> right into <b>your paragraph.</b> Pretty cool, right!</p>
<p>You could BREAK <br> the line, but it's not used very often these days.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
  <li>Item</li>
  <li>Item</li>
  <li>Another item</li>
</ul>
<p>w/ sub-lists</p>
<ol>
  <li>Item one</li>
  <li>Item two</li>
  <li>Item three
    <ul>
      <li>Sub-item</li>
      <li>Sub-item</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Item four</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com">I&#39;m a link to a web page!</a></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/81qyN1y.jpg" alt="This text will show up, only if the image doesn't (also good for screen readers)"></p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/profile.png" alt="local photo"></p>
```

Then go to `localhost:8080` (why does `localhost` work?). Open up your _developer tools ('ctrl+shift+i' on Windows or 'cmd+shift+i' on Mac OS X)

1. What `font-size` does the browser give an `<h2>` element by default?
2. What `font-size` does the browser give an `<h6>` element by default?
3. What `font-style` does the browser give an `<em>` element by default?
4. What `text-decoration` does the browser give an `<a>` element by default?
5. What `list-style-type` does the browser give a `<li>` element?

Where do these styles come from?

## Attributes

This link tag has an attribute whose name is `href` and whose value is a `url`:
`<a href="http://www.somewebsite.com">Some text for user to see on page</a>`

Attributes provide additional information about an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a **name** and a **value**, separated by an equals sign.

Image tags (`<img>`) have an attribute named `src` whose value is the location of the image to be displayed, like this:

```html
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/81qyN1y.jpg" alt="This text will show up, only if the image doesn't (also good for screen readers)">
```

Let's expand on the landing page we've already made for our online portfolio!

While it's possible to link to HTML documents in your website with any name (as long as they have the `.html` file extension), it's generally considered best practice to create new directories for each page. At the root of each new directory should be another `index.html` file. This makes the URL prettier when users search your site, and it organizes things a bit better for future developers. Let's set up a 'Projects' page using this method:

1. If you're already in the Portfolio page's root (or top-level) directory, make a new directory called 'projects' (HINT: `mkdir about`). Remember that different capitalizations are different addresses, so keep a consistent naming convention for all folders (i.e. don't capitalize any words, and separate multi-word directory names with hyphens, e.g. `my-favorite-directory` instead of `MyFavoriteDirectory`).
2. Now navigate into your newly-created projects folder (HINT: `cd about`) and create another `index.html` file (HINT: `touch index.html`).
3. Use VSCode to edit your new `about/index.html` file.
4. Set the page up just like any other HTML document.
5. Give the page a `<title>` of `Firstname Lastname | About`.
6. Now go back to your landing page (`/index.html`), and edit that file to include the following:
7. The profile image from `README.md`
8. The social media links from `README.md`
9. A "navigation list" at the top of your landing page, with links to 'Home' (`/`) and 'About' (`/about`).
10. At least one comment for future developers (or you!) using the syntax `<!-- comment text -->`
11. Repeat these tasks for 'Blog' and 'Contact' - For content, just add some basic `<heading>` content for these pages and we will work on them later.
12. `commit` and `push`
