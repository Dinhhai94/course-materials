# Welcome to the Savvy Coders Course Materials

## We're Glad You're Here

Over the next few weeks, we're going to learn a _lot_ of new things. Most of those things will be exciting; some will be initmidating; all of those things will help you to be a better web developer.

## Addl. Info

As the world of web development continually changes (mostly for the better), so will these _official_ course materials. The education team at Savvy Coders is committed to continually updating things with fresh new examples and explanations. However, most major changes will take place at deliberate times, usually in between cohorts.

## Savvy Coders 'Companion'

We have also just recently created a [companion notebook](https://www.notion.so/codefinity/Savvy-Coders-3a86e3eb7b204816b65cdd8dad624acb) of sorts that distills some of the finer points. It also adds more context and/or examples and even includes some videos!

This notebook is set up to accomodate rapid changes as needed for the current cohort and also helps us test out new examples and explanations before they are adopted into the _official_ course materials.

## Savvy Coders YouTube

In the near future, some of our lessons will be posted on the YT channel.
