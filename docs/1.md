# Local Dev Environment and First Steps

To start training to become professional developers, we should start witht he right tools for our **development environment**. These include the following:

1. A bash-friendly command-line interface
2. A version-control system
3. A text editor
4. A dependency-management utility
5. A native client for Slack

You'll also need a few online accounts to get started. These should _all be tied to the same email address_! These external accounts include:

1. Slack
2. GitHub
3. Netlify

Please reference the Savvy Coders notebook and go through our [video series](https://www.notion.so/codefinity/Setting-up-a-Local-Dev-Environment-97de62a546f943fbbc7a246b4785a343) before reading through the rest of this.

## Building a Dev Environment

Whenever we work on a project, we want to make sure that we are using a consistent set of tools. But installing those tools in a way that is consistent across operating systems is a tough problem! Most web developers use tools that are modeled after the UNIX family of operating systems. These tools are usually packaged as a form of **terminal emulator**.

Because each operating system is so different, we'll need to install a different set of tools to emulate the UNIX terminal through our command-line \(more on "command-lines" and "terminals" in a minute\):

### Linux

* Most Linux distributions ship with their own, fully-featured UNIX-based

  terminal emulators. Popular examples include GNOME Terminal, xterm, or

  Konsole \(depending on your desktop environment\).

* We also can take advantage of a cool framework that sits 'on top of' zsh that can greatly enhance our terminal experience: ["Oh My ZSH"](https://ohmyz.sh/)
* If you're using a minimalist distribution like Arch,

  please use [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), installed through your

  distribution's package manager \(e.g. `pacman -S kitty` for Arch users\).

### macOS

* For Mac users, the Terminal application works well as a UNIX-compliant

  command-line.

* If you would like a command-line application with more features, [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) is the _de facto_ choice of many devs.
* We also can take advantage of a cool framework that sits 'on top of' zsh that can greatly enhance our terminal experience: ["Oh My ZSH"](https://ohmyz.sh/) 
* For some versions of macOS, you will also need to consent to using XCode

  features. To trigger this installation/consent process, type in `git --version` and hit `ENTER`. If a version number is output to the screen,

  you're good to go. Otherwise, follow the prompts to make sure that you're

  set up with Terminal dev tools.

### Windows

* Windows is the tough one...the windows command line is notoriously _wrong_

  for web development. Luckily, the folks behind `git` have come up with a

  solution: `git-bash`, a UNIX-esque terminal emulator for Windows packaged

  with `git`!

* Do download both `git` and `git-bash`, head to [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads), hit the "Downloads for Windows" button, and go through the prompts to complete the installation process.
* Once the installation process above is complete, use the Windows key to

  search for "Git Bash". Use this command-line for the duration of this

  course.

### For All Platforms...

...you could use [Hyper](https://hyper.is/), although some folks feel that it's a bit resource heavy. 🤷🏾‍♂️

### Interfacing with Computers

The operating system is the program \(series of instructions\) that runs when you turn on your computer. It handles inputs \(keyboard, mouse, camera, network connections\) and outputs \(monitor, speakers, network connections\), manages shared access to computing resources and memory, and reads and writes data to the file system on behalf of any number of simultaneously running applications \(web browser, code editor, terminal emulator, music player, etc\). We interact with the computer through the operating system, usually by TYPING, TOUCHING, or CLICKING.

Computers can receive user input through either a command line interface \(CLI\) or a graphical user interface \(GUI\). In a command line interface \(A.K.A. "Console", "Command Line", "Terminal", or "Shell"\), the user types commands using the keyboard to tell the computer to take an action. The computer will display the results of the operation by writing text to the screen.

GOAL FOR THE COURSE: All navigation should be done using **words** instead of **pictures**, usually through our terminal emulators.

> "When I was a child, I used a computer by looking at the pictures. When I grew up, I learned to read and write." -William Shotts, Jr. Linux Command.org
>
> **NOTE**: From here on out, we'll use the terms `terminal`, `command-line`, and `CLI` interchangeably

To be exact, the terminal or terminal emulator is just the interface for us to enter words in. The shell \(e.g. 'bash' or 'zsh'\) is a program within the terminal that _executes_ some useful commands that we might type. Essentially, without the shell, our terminal would be un-usuable for all intents and purposes.

#### EXERCISE 1

We will start out by using the CLI to navigate through the file system on our personal computers. The key is to think of the directory structure as a 'tree' with 'branches', rather than a bunch of 1s and 0s stored in memory. The OS abstracts all of that memory management away, so you and I can work directly with the human-facing interface we call a file structure.

1. Open up your terminal of choice and type in `pwd`. What do you see?
2. Make a note of that folder's location, then repeat the process with your CLI
3. print your starting location: `pwd`
4. list the file structure: `ls`
5. change directories: `cd`
6. move up a directory: `cd ..`
7. move to your `$HOME` directory: `cd ~`
8. In your `$HOME` directory \(`~`\), create a folder called `Code` for all of your future coding projects. You can do that with the `mkdir` command \(e.g. `mkdir ~/Code`\)
9. Inside of `Code`, create a `SavvyCoders` directory for all of your Savvy-related work! You can do that with the `mkdir` command \(e.g. `mkdir ~/Code/SavvyCoders`\).

### Developer Accounts

There are a number of different online services that help us be productive. Here are three that we'll use for this class. When setting these up it behooves you to _associate these all with same email._

#### Slack

All of our communication will go through the class-specific Slack channel! Please sign up for an account \(if you haven't already\) and download the slack client for your OS through your package manager.

#### GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com) profiles are like a combination of LinkedIn and Facebook for developers, as well as a place to back up and store code. We'll learn more about how git and GitHub work later, but for now, it's important to create an account. When you've created an account, post a link to Slack, and follow the profiles of your classmates and instructors!

#### Netlify

Once you have a GitHub account, you can sign up for [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). We'll use Netlify for [Continuous Delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery)

### More Environment Tools

Beyond a package manager and CLI, we need a few more tools to help us work more efficiently.

#### `git`

Most Linux distributions come with `git` pre-installed, as does macOS. For Windows users, we already installed `git` as a part of downloading `git-bash` as your terminal emulator.

Verify that you have `git` installed by typing `git --version` into your terminal. You should see some numbers \(e.g. `2.17.1`\).

In some versions of macOS, you will need to install XCode tools before using `git`. This can be done in response to a series of prompts that will appear when you type `git --version` for the first time.

`git` is a version control system that tracks changes to the files in our project over time. The concept is that we take 'snapshots' of our project whenever we want to \(usually after completing a 'logical unit of work'\) and attach a clear `commit` message that describes what was just completed. This is typically done in the _imperative tense_ by convention \(e.g. 'Add navigation menu' or 'Fix bug in login form.', etc.\).

#### Visual Studio Code

The text editor that we'll be using for this course is called [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) \(_not_ Visual Studio, which is only available for Windows\). It's a modular editor built for web development, maintained by Microsoft, and contributed to by a large Open Source community.

If you're on macOS, install shell commands from the command pallette \(`CMD + SHIFT + P`\) by selecting the `Install 'code' command in PATH` option.

![command-palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/setup/mac/shell-command.png)

#### EXERCISE 2

1. Navigate to your `SavvyCoders` directory using your CLI.
2. Make a new directory called `FirstnameLastname` \(with YOUR first and last name, of course\) inside the `SavvyCoders` directory. \(HINT: `mkdir FirstnameLastname`\).
3. Navigate into your Portfolio Project directory \(HINT: `cd FirstnameLastname`\).
4. Also in your CLI, use the command `touch README.md` to create a new _MarkDown_ file named inside of `FirstnameLastname` directory.
5. You can open specific directories in VSCode using the `code .` command from your command line! Here, the `.` is an _argument_ that we are passing to the `code` command that reinforces that we want VS Code to open up directly in our current directory.

### Shortcut Keys \(Especially for VS Code!\)

Be sure to make a conscious decision to learn the [shortcut keys](https://www.notion.so/codefinity/Shortcut-Keys-a656884f9d404179871f9ed6bc35599b) as you work through this course!

For, now, be aware of 'ctrl/cmd + P' to open a 'fuzzy finder' for opening files. Simply start typing the name of a file \(for example 'README'\) and you wil see it in that one.

Also, you can use 'ctrl/cmd + shift + p' to open up the command pallette. This gives you options for each and every possible at any given juncture. It's also a a 'fuzzy finder.' For example, maybe you want to 'save' some work? Just start typing 'save' - **note that it shows you the shortcut keys.** This means you should make note of that, hit 'esc' to close the finder and use the shortcut key.

**Recommendation:** Make it a weekly habit to add 1-2 shortucut keys to your reporitoire. So, each week, make it a point to always use some new shortcuts instead of the mouse. In this way, after some time, you will get all of the major ones down.
