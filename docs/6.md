# CSS Basics

## Stylesheets

Let's create a stylesheet for our Portfolio Project that applies to all of our pages!

1. First, we need to create a separate file with the `.css` file extension. Let's go ahead and call it `style.css`. To keep things organized, let's create that file inside its own `css` directory \(since we might want to add multiple stylesheets to the same document\). 
  HINT:

  ```text
    mkdir css
    touch style.css
  ```

2. Next, we need to `link` that stylesheet to each of our pages. In the `<head>` of each page, add the following:

   ```markup
   <!-- for your landing page -->
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">

   <!-- for all other pages -->
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/style.css">
   ```

   _Do you know why we need different `href` values for our landing page and our projects and blog pages?_

3. At this point, there shouldn't be any difference in the way your pages look or behave, since there's nothing in `style.css`. For now, you should stage, commit, push, and deploy your page to make sure that everything looks the same in the browser.

## Concepts

### The CSS Box Model

Every HTML element has a box around it, even if you cannot see it. We can show a visible border around every HTML element on the page using the CSS border property and the "match all" selector:

```css
* {
  border: 1px solid red;
}
```

Try putting a border around each "boxed" element while you try out a few of the following properties:

1. The CSS padding property defines the extra space inside the border:

   ```css
   * {
     padding: 10px;
   }
   ```

   You can also assign different values to the `padding` on each side of an element with specific properties \(e.g. `padding-left`, `padding-right`, etc.\) or through the shorthand `padding` property. As an example, the following three `padding` constructs compile to the same appearance:

   ```css
   * {
     padding-top: 5px;
     padding-right: 10px;
     padding-bottom: 5px;
     padding-left: 10px;
   }
   ```

   ```css
   * {
     padding: 5px 10px 5px 10px;
   }
   ```

   ```css
   * {
     padding: 5px 10px;
   }
   ```

2. The CSS margin property defines the extra space outside the border:

   ```css
   * {
     margin: 30px;
   }
   ```

   The same shorthand rules that worked for `padding` also work for `margin`.

3. We can also manually set the width and height of the element itself.

   ```css
   * {
     width: 300px;
     height: 200px;
   }
   ```

   **What's the difference?** Check it out in the Elements panel of Chrome Dev Tools to inspect the spacing around the element.

   > NOTE: you can open the Elements panel with `CMD + Option + I` in macOS or with `CTRL + I` in Linux or Windows

## Complex CSS selectors

As our documents grow, we'll need to leverage more complex CSS selection syntax. Here are a few important selectors to cherish and to keep:

1. _The Universal Selector_

   ```css
   * {
     /* css that applies to every element */
   }
   ```

2. _The Class Selector_

   ```css
   div.container {
     /* css that only applies to divs with a class of 'container' */
   }
   ```

3. _The Direct Decendant Selector_

   ```css
   div > p {
     /* css that only applies to direct child elements (no grand-children) of an element */
     /* in this case, all of the child paragraph elements of divs across the page */
   }
   ```

4. _The Decendant Selector_

   ```css
   div p {
     /* css that applies to all descendants of an element of a certain type */
     /* in this case, all paragraph elements of divs across the page
        (even if they're nested in other elements, like spans or lists) */
   }
   ```

5. _The Direct Sibling Selector_

```css
div + footer {
  /* css that applies to the first footer sibling of a div */
}
```

1. _The General Sibling Selector_

```css
div ~ img {
  /* css that applies to all images that are siblings to divs */
}
```

These rules might seem like overkill right now, but they're extremely useful for when you have large stylesheets of CSS rules that apply across multiple pages. Speaking of which...

## Pseudo-stuff

There are some selectors that can be used to make some very basic calculations about the state of your markup, and add styles accordingly. These aren't real classes or selectors, since they aren't able to select anything on their own. Rather, these are used to filter the results of a selector into a useful subset of HTML elements to style. Here are a few of the most useful:

1. `:first-of-type`

   ```css
   li:first-of-type {
     /* applies to the first list item of every list */
   }
   ```

2. `:last-of-type`

   ```css
   li:last-of-type {
     /* applies to the last list item of every list */
   }
   ```

3. `:nth-of-type(n)`

   ```css
   li:nth-child(2) {
     /* applies to the second list item of every list */
   }
   ```

4. `:nth-of-type(an)`

   ```css
   li:nth-of-type(2n) {
     /* applies to every other list item of every list */
   }
   ```

5. `:hover`

   ```css
   li:hover {
     /* applies to every list item the user is hovering over */
   }
   ```
