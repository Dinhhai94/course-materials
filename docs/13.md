# Complex Data Types Review and DOM Interactions

## Complex Data Types Review

Let's revisit some of the Primitive Data types we covered in the last module:

1. **String**, e.g. `"Hello", "1", or ""`
2. **Number**, e.g. `1`, `1239`, `1.2`, or `1e4`
3. **Boolean**, e.g. `true` or `false`
4. `undefined` &lt;- that's, right _undefined_. In JavaScript, undefined values have their own data type!

Primitive data types like we covered in the last module are meant to represent a single piece of discrete data. It can be a large piece \(think of War and Peace as a single String\), but it's still just one item.

Complex or Composite data types represent **Collections** of data. One of the Complex data types in JavaScript is Objects. We've already created a few of these using _Literal Notation_.

**Objects** are collections of data just like Arrays, but we can access data by _name_ instead of _sequence_. All names are themselves arbitrary Strings that you're free to make up as you see fit. Let's try to re-write part of `myArray` as an Object:

```javascript
const myObject = {
  myString: "String",
  myNum: 23,
  myBoo: true
};

console.log(myObject["myString"]);
```

Objects are the foundation of an entire programming paradigm known as **Object Oriented Programming**, which we'll definitely be revisiting. For right now, it's enough to understand that we can store data in Objects and access them by name using either _bracket notation_ or a shortcut called _dot notation_.

Dot notation for the above example would be something like:

```javascript
console.log(myObject.myNum); // 23
```

Hopefully you recognize that we've already been working with built-in Objects, including `window` and `console`. Typing `window.location` was accessing the `location` property of the `window` Object provided by the browser. `console.log()` invokes the `log` function contained in a `console` Object provided by the browser. `window` and `console` are part of the BOM, or Browser Object Model \(notice the 'Object' part of that\). It's the collection of all of the data and built-in functions provided by the browser, that we can access at any time.

## JavaScript, the DOM, and YOU

### Document Object Model (DOM)

When we write HTML, we use opening and closing tags - we have 'parents' and 'children.'

```html
<body>
    <form action="#">
      <div>
        <label for="minimum">Minimum Value</label>
        <input type="number" id="minimum" />
      </div>

      <div>
        <label for="maximum">Maximum Value</label>
        <input type="number" id="maximum" />
      </div>

      <input type="submit" value="Sum!" />
    </form>

    <script src="./scripts.js"></script>
  </body>
```

We model this 'tree' of 'parents' and 'children' as the the Document Object Model (DOM), a 'subset' of the Browser Object Model (BOM). The BOM encompasses all of the parts of the browser - file uploads, clipboard, CSS painting, etc. While using BOM data is extremely useful, most of what users really care about happens inside the DOM: the _Document Object Model_. 

Now, to interface with the DOM, we need a convenient way to interact with it without manually 'hacking' into the browser and having to learn about all of its inner workings. Fortunately, JS has a built in object (recall that all the things in JS are objects except for primitives) - document. This serves an Application Programming Interface (API) - a collection  of convenience properties and methods that allow us to 'program' another application w/o having to know about all of the specific inner workings of it. 

**Because of the `document` `object`, we can 'program' the DOM in the 'browser' without having to become expert 'browser programmers.'**

Let's try exploring your Portfolio project through the `document` Object!

1. Navigate to the latest deployed version of your Portfolio Project in a browser, go to your blog page, then open up the developer console.
2. Try the following commands from the browser's REPL:

   ```javascript
   document.body;
   document.querySelector("p");
   document.querySelectorAll("p");
   document.querySelector("nav");
   document.querySelector("nav li").textContent;
   document.querySelector("h1").textContent = "I'm on the page!";
   ```

### Greeter Practice

Just like we did with the first `greeter` exercise, we can also manipulate the DOM through JavaScript files \(instead of the console\). To explore this further, let's add a new-and-improved greeter to your landing page in your Portfolio Project!

1. At the top of your content section, add a new `<div>` with the attribute `id='greeting'`.
2. Then we need to pick out the `#greeting` element of our HTML document and change its `.textContent` to include a greeting for our visitor. HINT:

   ```javascript
   const name = prompt("Hi there! What's your name?");
   const output = document.querySelector("#greeting");
   output.textContent = "Thanks for visiting, " + name + ".";
   ```

3. While `textContent` works, it would be nice if we could wrap our greeting in a `<p>` element to keep styling consistent. To do that, we'll use a different method attached to DOM nodes called `.innerHTML`. Try this:

   ```javascript
   const name = prompt("Hi there! What's your name?");
   const output = document.querySelector("#greeting");
   output.innerHTML = "<p>Thanks for visiting, " + name + ".</p>";
   ```

4. Now you can add some specific styles to `#greeting p` to make your greeting section look nice! Once your greeting area looks good, `add`, `commit`, `push`, and `deploy` your changes.
