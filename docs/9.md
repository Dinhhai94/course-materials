# Tablet/Desktop View

## Tablet Media Queries

Now that we have established our 'baseline' 'mobile-first' styles, it's time to override those styles under certain conditions - namely the 'device width.' We'll do this by querying(asking) our media about some of its characteristics such as it's width. We'll establish rules based on these results. Here's a simple example:

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  header {
    background: red;
  }
}
```

Using your dev tools, try toggling your device emulator between a phone and tablet. You should see that the `background-color` of your `header` is toggling changing. Looking 👆🏾, we see that if our device is a `screen` (as opposed to `print`, etc.), and the device's screen size is more than `768px`, the `header` has a different rule that is being applied. Make sense?

### `<nav>`

Now, let's do something a bit more practical and hide our 🍔, whilst showing our navigation horizontally. To accomplish this, let's use a couple more 'state' classes:

- `.is-hidden--tablet` /* Hide the 🍔. */
- `.is-shown--tablet` /* Show the <nav>. */

👆🏾will be applied inside of a `@media` query.

Finally, just add some _flexbox_ to get that `<nav>` looking nice. 

```css
/* Media queries */
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  nav ul {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-around;
  }

  .is-hidden--tablet {
    font-size: 0;
    height: 0;
  }

  .is-shown--tablet {
    font-size: initial;
    height: 100%; /* Take as much height as needed within the parent. */
  }
}
```

**Note:** Don't get married 💒 to `768px`. We are just using that as a quick example. In a 'detail-oriented' design, you would just gauge your `@media`s by shrinking and expanding your screen and making decisions about when things 'look bad,' etc.

### `section p`

One other thing that we can easily fix for our 'tablet' view is to limit how wide the our `<p>` tag gets in our `<section>`s.

```css
section p {
    max-width: 600px;
  }
```

**Hint:** Just include 👆🏾inside that same `@media` we made earlier.

## Desktop Media Queries

### `header`

For a 'desktop' view, let's just choose `1024px`. Again, for a 'real design,' you may want to play with screen widths and be much more particular.

We can simply change our `header` to use `flex-direction: row;`, and throw some `margin-right` on the `figure` - maybe some `padding`, etc.

### `.hero`

We'll probably want to use a larger 'lorem picsum' image, and we could increase the `height` or `.hero` to `40vh`, etc.

### `main`

🙆🏾‍♂️Here's where things get interesting. We want to create our '3-column' layout for the `section`s inside of `main`. First, we'll need to use a `<div>` to wrap those 3 `<section>`s to that `.hero` doesn't get changed. This `<div>` serves as a `flex` 'container,' and just by applying `display: flex` we get most of our job done!

```html
<main>
      <div class="hero">
        <a href="#" class="btn">Fake CTA Btn</a>
      </div>

      <div class="sections-container">
        <section>
          <h2>Some Fake Heading</h2>
          <p>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Corporis
            obcaecati, aliquam ex, hic sed autem repudiandae quas ipsum explicabo
            nemo reprehenderit, nihil iure temporibus? Distinctio odit excepturi
            corrupti at animi.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Corporis
            obcaecati, aliquam ex, hic sed autem repudiandae quas ipsum explicabo
            nemo reprehenderit, nihil iure temporibus? Distinctio odit excepturi
            corrupti at animi.
          </p>
          <a href="" class="btn btn--read">Read More!</a>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Some Fake Heading</h2>
          <p>
            Voluptates incidunt vero aperiam ipsum vel quod ex maiores tenetur!
            Temporibus illo iusto repellendus excepturi ullam, illum quo atque
            necessitatibus odit, nulla reiciendis, labore ipsa vero ducimus
            consectetur nisi praesentium.
          </p>
          <a href="" class="btn btn--read">Read More!</a>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Some Fake Heading</h2>
          <p>
            Aperiam quaerat voluptatum assumenda cupiditate distinctio,
            consequatur, omnis beatae aut repudiandae dicta pariatur atque optio
            sed ratione enim, libero nemo! Sit adipisci nisi veritatis excepturi
            aperiam eum corrupti maxime sed.
          </p>
          <a href="" class="btn btn--read">Read More!</a>
        </section>
      </div>
    </main>
```

I've added an extra `<p>` 👆🏾. This throws off the alignment of our `.btn-read`s. To fix that, we'll need to make our `<section>`s be both 'flex children' *and** 'flex parents'. You can review all of the details of this implementation and the other parts of the 'desktop' view in the video below:
