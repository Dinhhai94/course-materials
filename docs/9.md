# Tablet/Desktop View

## Tablet Media Queries

Now that we have established our 'baseline' 'mobile-first' styles, it's time to override those styles under certain conditions - namely the 'device width.' We'll do this by querying(asking) our media about some of its characteristics such as it's width. We'll establish rules based on these results. Here's a simple example:

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  header {
    background: red;
  }
}
```

Using your dev tools, try toggling your device emulator between a phone and tablet. You should see that the `background-color` of your `header` is toggling changing. Looking 👆🏾, we see that if our device is a `screen` (as opposed to `print`, etc.), and the device's screen size is more than `768px`, the `header` has a different rule that is being applied. Make sense?

### `<nav>`

Now, let's do something a bit more practical and hide our 🍔, whilst showing our navigation horizontally. To accomplish this, let's use a couple more 'state' classes:

- `.is-hidden--tablet` /* Hide the 🍔. */
- `.is-shown--tablet` /* Show the <nav>. */

👆🏾will be applied inside of a `@media` query.

Finally, just add some _flexbox_ to get that `<nav>` looking nice. 

```css
/* Media queries */
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  nav ul {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-around;
  }

  .is-hidden--tablet {
    font-size: 0;
    height: 0;
  }

  .is-shown--tablet {
    font-size: initial;
    height: 100%; /* Take as much height as needed within the parent. */
  }
}
```

**Note:** Don't get married 💒 to `768px`. We are just using that as a quick example. In a 'detail-oriented' design, you would just gauge your `@media`s by shrinking and expanding your screen and making decisions about when things 'look bad,' etc.

### `section p`

One other thing that we can easily fix for our 'tablet' view is to limit how wide the our `<p>` tag gets in our `<section>`s. 

```css
section p {
    max-width: 600px;
  }
```

**Hint:** Just include 👆🏾inside that same `@media` we made earlier.
