# Markdown and `git`

## Markdown

Markdown is a markup language. Markup languages mix in special sequences of coded characters to specify the intended layout and style of their text.

Review this Markdown code and re-type (not copy/paste else your learning outcome will be reduced) into your VSCode code editor. Search for 'markdown preview' (ctrl/cmd + shift + p) to have it parsed and rendered:

```markdown
# This is a header

## This is an even smaller header

### Even smaller...

###### Quite small

Here is some normal text. A paragraph, even!

_This text is in italics._

**This text is in bold.**

**_This text is in both._**

~~This text is rendered with strikethrough.~~

Sometimes you want to embed some \*stylized text\*
right into **your paragraph.** Pretty cool, right!

#### EXERCISE 3

Practice each piece of MD shown above. Write a short personal introduction with some appropriate headers! Include some contact
information as lists, list some hobbies, add a favorite quote, and include linked images. More specifically, use your personal avatar, and link that to a LinkedIn page, if you have that (if not, set a basic one up b/c you will need to do that prior to graduation anyway).

You'll want to preview this inside of VS Code's MarkDown Preview as described earlier.

### Version Control with `git`

To help us maintain, back up, and share our codebases, we're going to use `git` (the command-line tool) and GitHub (the online repository). These tools are fundamental parts of the web developer's workflow, and you'll be using them _every day_ for the rest of your programming career!

`git` works a bit like a Time Machine, in the sense that you'll be able to revert to any saved state within a directory. So if you mangle your site's directory structure, you can always use `git` to revert back to simpler times. The important things to understand about `git` specifically:

1. This is a CLI utility, so get ready for lots of text. All of our important files when programming will be text, so its only natural that we'd be navigating between save states (called 'commits') using text as well.
2. Arbitrarily or automatically saving code is NOT a feature of `git`, and it shouldn't be. You only want to save meaningful chunks of code (e.g. a feature), not broken pieces here and there. Otherwise, there's no way to revert back to a useful save-state!
3. Because of point \#2, 'saving' your progress with `git` is handled a bit differently. _You_ are in charge of 'staging' your commits, and 'committing' changes only when _you_ are ready.

#### EXERCISE 4

Let's get our feet wet with `git` by configuring our user identity.

1. In any command prompt, type the following (using your name and email, of course):

   ```shell
   $ git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
   $ git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

2. You can check all of your configuration settings by typing

   ```shell
   $ git config --list
   ```

That wasn't so bad, right?

#### EXERCISE 5

`git` works by creating a folder within the 'working directory' (the directory that you would like to track/save over time). The first step to saving any project, then, is to navigate to this 'working directory' and create that `git` folder (named `.git`). Let's set up your portfolio project as a `git` repository to track over time.

1. First, navigate to your `~/Code/SavvyCoders/FirstnameLastname` directory.
2. Next, while still the `FirstnameLastname` directory, type the following:

   ```shell
   $ git init
   ```

3. That _should_ have created a `.git` folder, which is hidden by default. There are two ways to make sure that our `git init` command worked. Try these both out:

   - list all of the hidden folders (including `.git`) in `FirstnameLastname`:

   ```shell
   $ ls -a
   ```

   You should see a folder called `.git` in the output.  Now try running a simple `git` command:

   ```shell
   $ git status
   ```

   If you get `FATAL: FirstnameLastname is not a git repository`, something has gone wrong. If everything worked, you should see something like this:

   ```shell
   $ git status
   On branch master
   Initial commit
   Untracked files:
     (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
           README.md
   nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add"    to track)
   ```

4. Once `git` is _initialized_ (`init` = initialize), we should be able start saving snapshots of our work. Before committing our work, though, we have to _stage_ our changes. You can do that with the following command:

   ```shell
   $ git add .
   ```

   That `.` at the end is very important! That's telling `git` to stage everything in the working directory at once. To make sure that everything worked, type in `git status` again. You should get output that looks something like this:

   ```shell
   $ git status
   On branch master
   Initial commit
   Changes to be committed:
     (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
           new file:   README.md
   ```

5. As nice as it is to get this far, we **still** haven't committed our changes yet. So we wouldn't be able to roll back to this point in the event of error, because `README.md` is still waiting to be fully committed. Let's do that with the following command:

   ```shell
   $ git commit -m "First commit"
   ```

   `git` forces us to create a _commit message_ whenever a commit is made. This is a short snippet of text that helps you remember exactly what was changed in each commit. Normally committing and creating a commit are two different steps, but you can combine the two by adding the `-m` flag (for 'message'), followed by your custom commit message in quotation marks. If everything works as planned, you should see something like the following output:

   ```shell
   $ git commit -m "First commit"
   [master (root-commit) ee6ac27] First commit
    1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
    create mode 100644 README.md
   ```

6. Now if you run `git log`, you'll see a list containing your entire `git` history (it should be pretty short at the moment). But we still only have _one copy_ of our codebase. To back up our work, let's use GitHub! The first step is to [create a new repository on online GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/).
7. After you've created your new repository, you'll need to link that repo to your current project directory. You can do that with `git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/YOUR-REPO-ADDRESS.git`. If you've done this correctly, you should see the word `origin` pop up in the command-line when you type `git remote`.
8. Now we need to **push** our local commit (called 'First commit', containing only the README.md file) to the remote repository. To do that, enter the following command:

   ```shell
   $ git push origin master
   ```

9. If that worked, you should see your `README.md` file appear in your GitHub GUI after a page refresh (F5). Now you have two copies of your `git` repository... nice work!
