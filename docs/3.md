# Local Development, Packages and Linters

## Let's Start Developing Locally Using Best Practices and Industry Standards

### stylelint.io

One of the main languages we will be working with in the near future will be _Cascading Style Sheets(CSS)._ These should be familiar to you from the class 'pre-work.'

CSS, like JS, lacks any 'hard and fast' rules regarding how you implement it. You can use all kinds of selectors and rules in various ways and CSS itself doesn't really care - it _usually_ just works. Because of this, it's easy to get 'sloppy' and write CSS in a manner that will lead towards disorganization and confusion for both you and your potential co-workers, especially on larger, 'real ' projects. What can we do to alleviate this?

Well, on most well-organized development teams, there is someone that sets forth coding standards that other developers should adhere to. This allows for better collaboration and for developers to essentially fill in for one another. It also means that, even as a solo developer, there will be some consistency such that when you review an older project after some time, it will be easier for you to make sense of what you wrote previously.

These 'style guides' can vary from company to company, so if lieu of this we are going to apply some 'general best practices' that draw from many industry leaders including [Google,](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#CSS_Formatting_Rules) [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/css#css) and others. And, what's going to really make this seamless is the use of [Stylelint](stylelint.io) integrated with the [Stylelint extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shinnn.stylelint). In this way, we can be 'sloppy' if we want to be, but we will automatically get alerted whenever we do.

#### `npm`

Now, [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/node-api) has multiple ways in which it can be installed. We are going to take advnatage of `npm` - Node's Package Manager. This gives us access to [a collection of JS-driven tooling](https://www.npmjs.com/) that we can easily add/remove as needed on a project-by-project basis. 

To accomplish this, *from our `FirstnameLastname` directory,* we will _initialize our project to use `npm`_. `npm init`. A series of questions will follow as shown which will generate a file called 'package.json.' Watch the video below for more details on this before reading further.

After this we can utilize `npm` to `install` away. For now, just do: `npm install stylelint stylelint-config-standard stylelint-prettier prettier --save-dev`

The above command will reach out to the `npm` registry on the internet and bring in many packages of code that will bring in `stylelint` itself and some accompanying 'standard' configurations to enforce *how* we write our CSS. Also included is `prettier`, to help us with how our code itself is formatted.

When it's all done, you will notice an update to your 'package.json.' A new key called `"devDependencies"` is not there. This is a listing of packages that we are using that our project is **dependent** on but only for **development** purposes. !["devDependencies" in package.json](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d7jj1im0b539tyj/devDependencies.png?dl=0)
