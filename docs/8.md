# Mobile View Styling

## `<nav>`

Let's start by removing this ugly 'bullet points' in our `<ul>`. In fact, we can just remove those from all of our `<ul>`s like so:

```css
ul {
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

Next, let's center our text for `nav ul` (this selects _any_ children `<ul>`s that are inside of `<nav>`) with `text-align: center`.

Let's remove the underlines from `nav a` with `text-decoration: none`.

Feel free to make any other adjustments, for example with `margin` and `padding`. (HINT: Apply a `margin: 0` on your `<ul>`.)

### Font Awesome

For the `<nav>`, we will want to introduce a üçî icon that will show/hide our navigation. You've probably seen this effect on most 'responsively designed' websites when browsing the web on your ‚òéÔ∏è. We'll use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&q=hamburger) (you should have already linked that stylesheet earlier) to place this icon.

Try pasting this: `<span class="fas fa-bars"></span>` as the _first child_ of your `<nav>` (so, it should be above and outside of the `<ul>`) We are using `<span>` because that gives us a 'generic' tag that is `inline` (as opposed to `<div>` which is a 'generic' `block` tag). These 2 tags are great when we just need a 'placeholder' to apply some special styles. In this case, we are using special _classes_ provided by Font Awesome. These classes reference the stylesheet that we linked to early via the CDN.

When you refresh your 'localhost', you should see the icon.

That's really small, isn't it? Well, let's fix that in 'style.css'. Let's move all the way to the bottom and add a _CSS Comment:_ `/* Class Selectors*/` Since classes override tag selectors in CSS, it's not a bad idea to just put them at their own section at the bottom of the page.

Font Awesome's icons are are actually fonts, not images. So, we'll need to work with `font-size` (as opposed to `width`).

```css
/* Class Selectors. */

.fas {
  font-size: 4.8em; /* 48px - Gives a nice 'clickable' target as per: https://material.io/design/layout/spacing-methods.html#touch-targets */
}
```
